# Create and write to a text file


f = open('myfile.txt', 'w') # open() with "w" creates the file (or overwrites if it already exists)

# write() adds text to the file

f.write("This is some text written\n")
f.write("Python makes file handling easy\n")

f.close() # close() is important to save the file
